Requires: depthsense sdk, python2, simplecv
Make sure to add the docs/softkinect.conf file to your /etc/ld.conf.d/ folder for linking

Looks for sdk in /opt/softkinect folder. You can get the SDK from softkinect sites

If everythings inorder, install with the following command:
	sudo python2 setup.py install

run sample_use.py to see if its all good

Note the python2 thing is cause of simplecv, code requires minor changes to work with python3 (change the python header, dont use the simplecv functions)

Don't stay quiet, if there's issues setting this up, Let me know.

Also if anyone can get the Depthsense ARM/Android SDK (it exists, somewhere) let me know, I need it!

Requires: depthsense sdk, python2, simplecv
Make sure to add the docs/softkinect.conf file to your /etc/ld.conf.d/ folder for linking

Looks for sdk in /opt/softkinect folder. You can get the SDK from softkinect sites

If everythings inorder, install with the following command:
	sudo python2 setup.py install

run sample_use.py to see if its all good

Note the python2 thing is cause of simplecv, code requires minor changes to work with python3 (change the python header, dont use the simplecv functions)
